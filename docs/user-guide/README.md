## üí° Key Concepts

### Ensemble AI Processing
The system uses multiple AI models that vote on the best result, providing more robust and reliable processing than single-model approaches.

### Adaptive Intelligence
Automatic seafloor type detection adjusts processing parameters for optimal results across different underwater environments.

### Constitutional AI
Built-in rules and constraints ensure processed data maintains physical plausibility and doesn't introduce artifacts.

### Expert Review Integration
Human experts can review and validate results, with the system learning from their feedback to improve future processing.

### Quality-First Approach
Every processing result includes comprehensive quality metrics aligned with international hydrographic standards.

## üìä Supported Workflows
